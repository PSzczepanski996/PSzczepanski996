### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Patrick SzczepaÅ„ski, and I live in [Olsztyn](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Olsztyn/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x46e2792d071419c7:0x106a8126cf54c20f?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiA6auf16n4AhUBv4sKHaj0BhgQ8gF6BAhhEAE) since I was born.  
I'm currently finishing [Informatic Technology](http://wmii.uwm.edu.pl/) studies at [University of Warmia and Mazury](http://www.uwm.edu.pl/).  
I also have almost 4 years experience with writing *various* django (python-based web framework) stuff.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on myself - I really want to take break from IT stuff and lose weight
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning real frontend frameworks, other than *jQuery*
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Linux or Hackintoshes - do you remember GNU/Linux paste or golden Hackintosh Poland 2015/2016 era?
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: send mail to **p.szczepanski996@gmail.com**
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have speech impediment, that led to funny situations in my high school

### My projects:

- [Rememberize](https://github.com/PSzczepanski996/Rememberize)

Project that provides you functionality to remember every form in just... cookies. Do you believe that?
- [BuklakiTheGame](https://github.com/Kropka-UWM/BuklakiTheGame)

First game for subject called "Team Project" at my studies written in javascript, jQuery and Django.
- [Kropka-App1](https://github.com/Kropka-UWM/Kropka-App1)

Big application that provides you way to manage students for practice/work, not finished due to lack of time.  
Has chat functionality (based on websockets/django-channels), views based on REST framework API, and VueJS frontend demo.  
I want also to thank my friend Grzesiek that provided me some parts of code (mainly frontend) and testing/debugging.

- [io_projekt](https://github.com/PSzczepanski996/io_projekt)

Application that manages dispatchers and Taxi drivers, written in pure Django and jQuery.

- [xapian_haystack](https://github.com/PSzczepanski996/xapian-haystack)

Xapian-haystack port to new versions of Django made years ago (now it's unneccesary because there is new main repository maintainer).
